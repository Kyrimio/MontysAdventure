  This game was a requirement for our 3rd Year Course "Implementation and Management of Software Engineering". This repository was created to store the game files in order to run the game.
   Monty's Adventures is a simple platforming game that features small and helpful python lessons to teach beginners how to code in python. The application was developed using Unreal Engine 4.
